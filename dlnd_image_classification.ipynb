    "# Image Classification\n",
    "In this project, you'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.\n",

    "The dataset is broken into batches to prevent your machine from running out of memory.  The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 5 batches, named `data_batch_1`, `data_batch_2`, etc.. Each batch contains the labels and images that are one of the following:\n",
    "* airplane\n",
    "* automobile\n",
    "* bird\n",
    "* cat\n",

    "* truck\n",

    "Understanding a dataset is part of making predictions on the data.  Play around with the code cell below by changing the `batch_id` and `sample_id`. The `batch_id` is the id for a batch (1-5). The `sample_id` is the id for a image and label pair in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself \"What are all possible labels?\", \"What is the range of values for the image data?\", \"Are the labels in order or random?\".  Answers to questions like these will help you preprocess the data and end up with better predictions."

However, you might notice people are getting scores [well above 80%](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#43494641522d3130).  That's because we haven't taught you all there is to know about neural networks. We still need to cover a few more techniques.\n",
